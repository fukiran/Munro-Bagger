# Munro-Bagger
Group project focused on working as a team, using Agile methodology. 
We were tasked with creating our own brief and MVP for a full stack app and using API to bring content and database to store information. 
Technology used: Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, Vue.js, Trello and Leaflet.js for interactive maps. 
Metoffice API is used to create a weather forecast for a selected Munro and the list of visited Munros stored in the database.
